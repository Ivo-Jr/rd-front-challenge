# Teste-frontend-raia-drogasil

This is a technical challenge for Frontend Developer. Some parts of this application's code were purposely subtracted. At these points, there will be an indication that something was there. Your task is to identify what is missing and complete the code to get the application back up and running.

## Technologies used

HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. That simple. No libs, no frameworks, no external dependencies.
No CSS Framework was used (Bootstrap, PureCss, etc.);

## How to use

- Install dependencies, run
$ yarn

- Run the application in your browser


## Operation

After logging in with any valid email and a password of at least 5 digits, the user will be directed to a session that will last for 5 min. This section contains different github profiles. It will not be necessary to log out automatically, but after a refresh at the end of the session, the user will be directed to the login screen.
